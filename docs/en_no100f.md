# Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

-Upgrades like the Springs/Umbrella as well as Gum and Soap Ammo upgrades will always be shuffled. 

-Optionally you can also shuffle Monster Tokens, Keys, Warp Gates(WIP) and Scooby Snack Pickups(WIP).

## Key Rando Notes
**Some rooms will behave differently than others, there is however a rhyme and reason to it:**

-If the keys in a room cause another object to open/move (e.g. Clamor 4/Tomb 1) Then you will need to recollect the key in the room once you've been sent it to open up the path.

-If a set of keys relies on a counter and opens a path once all are collected (e.g. Tomb 3, Mind Your Manners) then you will need to reload the area and collect all the keys in the set to open up the path

-If a set of keys opens up a loading zone upon collection (e.g. Hedge/Fishing Village/Shiver) them the keys do not need to be collected - the loading zone will immediately open up once you have found all of the keys in the set

## What is the goal of Scooby Doo: Night of 100 Frights?

Same as vanilla, beat Tim Curry in a brawl to the death.
