## Known Issues
-It is theoretically possible to run out of scooby snacks that are accessible, saving before using snack gates may be a good idea for now until this is accounted for in logic

-The Groundskeeper has decided to become invisible when you don't have the shovel, I wish I knew why - you can still pick up the shovel from him despite his ghostly nature.
